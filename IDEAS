Ideas about how to not get stuck in a ball of spaghetti code.

Keep UI separate. Really. Have it in a separate module ('ui'), and have it
expose just the interface you need. Then implement that interface. Iterate
in the browser console and distill to the ui module.

**Use an object capability model.**
Automate: I think it is statically possible to verify that a JavaScript
function with "use strict" does not capture any globals in its closure (I
think that JSLint and other tools already do this if you turn off all
globals).
This also will be good for being accountable about performance.
