Tip:
./node_modules/.bin/ contains executables of any packages you have
installed locally.

Appears to be a legit, no-nonsense testing frameword.
http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/
The successor of expresso. Supports both TDD and BDD style.
Oh wow, this is fantastic:
http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/example/tests.html
This would make great documentation.
Also, mocha appears to have a nice integration with coverage reporters.

Tip:
It looks like there is a common practice of putting housekeeping tasks in a
top-level Makefile. I think it's mostly a convenient way to put a name on
specific commands and specify minimal dependencies between them. It's
always like just one tiny command, so none of the "badness" of make (such
as when using it in a build system) comes through.
Since make is available everywhere, it's convenient.
E.g.:
 test:
   ./node_modules/.bin/mocha \
     --reporter list

 .PHONY: test
Also, you have a lightweight power to parametrize things, like:
  $ make test REPORTER=list
With
  REPORTER ?= dot
in the Makefile.
This also is a good place to put calls to ./node_modules/.bin/somecommand.

There's also `npm run-script` for this kind of automation, and a couple
built-in "shortcuts" like `npm start`, `npm test`, etc.
See `npm help scripts`.
I think the makefile way is generally more robust and slightly more
flexible. It makes sense for the npm scripts functionality to call into
single Makefile commands. E.g.
  "scripts": {
    "test": "make test-all"
  },
which still allows the flexibility of make for manual runs.

Handy:
require() can read and parse JSON files automatically.

Pin dependencies to git commit-ish's (see `npm help json`):

Ah, `npm help developers` for an intro to using npm to help your
development workflow.

Interesting:
  "It’s actually the policy in node.js that users do not call new on APIs
  in core and most modules follow the same patten of returning an
  instantiated object from a normal function to remove this confusion from
  taking place."
I should keep that in mind. (and use the instanceof "ctor guard" in
constructors).

  It is a tenet of Node that any API that abstracts from the programmer the
  fact that they are going to do an IO operation is not Node.
This one is cool:
  Node is not going to include that module.
  Node will not grow to include new modules, no matter how good they are or
  how distributed they’ve become. The kind of inclusion that you see across
  other platforms that grow large standard libraries has a negative effect
  on continued growth and maturity of the module community.
I think that C++ could benefit from this.

Not really related to node, but: http://freenode.net/catalysts.shtml

I love this talk:

Not many other languages allow something this simple.
  module.exports = function () {}
The simple callback pattern error-first, then success. It *works*. It may
be a bit ugly, but the fact of the matter is that it is ubiquitous,
unbelievably simple, instantly understandable, and ultimately gives the
greatest generality and doesn't introduce unnecessary abstractions or
ceremeonly (that e.g. a future library might).
  request.get(url, function (e, resp) {
    // something...
  });
When things get more complicated, it's easy to manage these callbacks when
you *decide to manage them*. For example, use the extremely popular `async`
module: https://github.com/caolan/async
Github defines a language for contribution. This has eliminated whole
classes of discussions from the node ecosystem that other projects have to
deal with.


This code is beautiful:

Useful for automation.


The callback interface is "universal" and composable. That's why it works.
It's straightforward. It hides nothing; you know exactly what it is going
to do.

node debug foo.js
(and use the `debugger;` statement)


From <http://www.nodebeginner.org/>:
  Passing functions is not only a technical consideration. With regard to
  software design, it's almost philosophical. Just think about it: in our
  index file, we could have passed the router object into the server, and
  the server could have called this object's route function.

  This way, we would have passed a *thing*, and the server would have used
  this thing to do something. Hey, router thing, could you please route
  this for me?

  But the server doesn't need the thing. It only needs to get something
  *done*, and to get something done, you don't need things at all, you need
  *actions*. You don't need nouns, you need verbs.
