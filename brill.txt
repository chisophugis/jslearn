This idea of "continuables" is really brilliant:

It basically has all the benefits of a promise (i.e. that it is a concrete
value that can be passed around, and that abstractions can be built on
that), while still retaining the simplicity of callbacks.

For example, they can be composed sequentially and in parallel.
