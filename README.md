JS code. Me messing around. Notes.

Beware: I didn't make any effort to clean my tracks, so stuff that
represents my "current understanding" is mixed with old stuff (and even the
git history isn't going to be much help in teasing them apart). If you want
more info about a particular thing, I can point you to the resource that I
was learning from; just email me or otherwise get in contact.
