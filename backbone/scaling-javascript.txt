Avoid defining more than one datatype in a single place. Otherwise, things
get tangled.
One reason for this is that it is really hard to "orient yourself" because
things can be done in lots of different orders. E.g. in C++ it's easy to
see "oh, I'm at the end of a class" or to easily scan for all the classes
in a file, but it's not really possible to do that in JavaScript since
there are multiple ways to do it. The solution is to only define one thing
in a given place (e.g. per file).
